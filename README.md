# Reverse-TCP-using-Python-Ethical-hacking-
Creating a reverse TCP method using networking concepts of Python(Only for Educational Purpose).

Reverse TCP : In a normal forward connection, a client connects to a server through the server's open port, but in the case of a reverse connection, the client opens the port that the server connects to.

# Prerequisites
Networking basic knowlegde 

# Running the test for Reverse TCP

1. Check your sytem IP adress by ipconfig or ifconfig and add the same in client.py HOST
2. Run server.py to create socket connections and listen to ports
3. Now run client.py on different terminal to check locally or compile client.py to exe and send it to a friend and tell them to run
4. Now when we go connection, Satrt entering cmd commands like ls/dir ,mkdir, cd etc
